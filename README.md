# CSE_424_Pattern-Recognition

### Submission-1 (Paper Review)
  The paper presents MCapsNet, an advanced deep learning model combining a modified Capsule Network with attention mechanisms to improve crop pest recognition, outperforming traditional CNNs and showing strong potential for real-world agricultural use.

### Submission-2 (Paper Review)
  This paper proposes a feature fusion network combining CNN and Transformer models with an attention-selection mechanism for robust insect pest recognition, achieving superior performance on the IP102 dataset and offering broader applications in visual classification tasks.

### Submission-3 (dataset ,dataset pre processing)
   The Sentinel satellites, Sentinel-2A and
 Sentinel-2B, which are carefully managed by the European
 Space Agency (ESA) for Earth observation, provide a wealth
 of data that contributes to the robustness of the EuroSAT
 dataset.

### Submission-5 (findings and proposed paper description)
â€”Building and testing deep learning models to classify
 EuroSAT satellite images, with an emphasis on the multispectral
 dataset. Data preprocessing, model construction, and evaluation
 are the various stages that make up the methodology. Scaling
 from minimum to maximum and balancing classes are applied
 to the EuroSAT dataset. The classification process makes use of
 the VGG16 and ResNet50 models implemented in a convolutional
 neural network (CNN) architecture. During training, the model
 is made more resilient by using data augmentation. Criteria
 like classification accuracy, categorical cross-entropy loss, and
 class-specific evaluations are all part of the review. As far as
 accuracy and loss go, the VGG16-based model beats ResNet50,
 which means it should work well with the RuroSAT multispectral
 dataset. Class-specific evaluations reveal variations in land cover
 classification accuracy. Makes a significant contribution to Eu
roSAR image classification by providing trustworthy models that
 highlight the significance of state-of-the-art CNN architecture,
 careful dataset preparation, and stringent evaluation methods.
 Visualization is a powerful tool for comprehending the dynamics
 of model learning and performance during the testing and
 training phases.
